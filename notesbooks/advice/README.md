This folder contains advice in the form of Noteable notebooks. The advice is specific to the plugins and tasks that ChatGPT is currently working with. For instance, when using the ChatSshPlug plugin, ChatGPT should be instructed to read the 'advice_chatsshplug.ipynb' notebook. Similarly, when working with the Noteable plugin, the 'advice_noteable.ipynb' notebook should be read.
